# Consult

## Project Description
<p>Consult is an application specifically created for physicians to bring all communication to one platform. To meet the requested objectives, the app was to include:</p>
1. A communications feature: 
- This page offers the physicians a centralized chat page which allows for direct consultations between physicians, creation of multidisciplinary teams to discuss cases as well as offering a medical directory for all physicians in the facility.
2. A tasks feature:
- This page offers the physicians an inbuilt calendar that shows the days events, meetings and pending assignments. This feature also extends an alert notification and group tasks to allow physicians to pick up tasks and collaborate with other colleagues.
